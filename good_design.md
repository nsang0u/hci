Title: Good Design at Williams College
Subtitle: HCI Assignment 1
---


For my example of 'good design,' I picked this somewhat cute piece of hardware: the Wii Remote. I imagine that many of us in this course are familiar with the 'wiimote,' as are many kids who've grown up over the past ten years. The user population of the wii remote, and naturally the Nintendo Wii, is largely comprised of children, teenagers and recent adults suffering from nostalgia, like myself. 



Also crucial to the quality of the wiimote's design is the GUI aspect of its use. Upon powering on the wii, it can be used simply by pointing the remote at what it is the user wants do select, aided by the pointer on the TV screen. The wii remote's technological innovation in its use of accelerometers helps facilitate natural ease of use and functionality for the user.
