# The Nintendo Wii Remote

  For my example of 'good design,' I picked this somewhat cute piece of hardware: the Wii Remote. I imagine that many of us in this course are familiar with the 'wiimote,' as are many kids who've grown up over the past ten years. The user population of the wii remote, and naturally the Nintendo Wii, is largely comprised of children, teenagers and recent adults suffering from nostalgia, like myself.  
  I selected the wii remote as an example of good design as it seems, in my opinion, to match nearly every axiom outlined by Oliver Reichenstein in his article *Learn to See*. Firstly, let's consider the wii remote from the perspective of the two axes of layperson's taste and expert's evaluation. With respect to its function, which is controlling the wii console, the wii remote works very well. All tasks can be achieved with the few buttons on the remote. This is not to say that fewer buttons is better, but rather that the wii remote is simple and easy to use and understand in its minimalism. Some remotes require far more button pressing and, with their complexity, inhibit the actual use of the remote to accomplish tasks. It's important to note, as well, that the wii was not marketed to hardcore gamers who might be willing to put in the time and effort to learn to use a complex remote. For it's intended market, the wii remote is functional.  
  I would further contend that the wii remote is 'pretty' by American consumer standards. Perhaps similarly to what Apple did with the computer and cell phone, Nintendo traded the chunky, black plastic remotes of years past for a sleek, 'layperson minimalistic' aesthetic, which is all the rage these days. As the wiimote is both highly functional, and pretty it is thus functionally beautiful.  
  Let's consider some of the other design principles Reichenstein discusses. The design of the wii remote is unobtrusive, honest and self-explanatory-- all aspects which Dieter Ram's identifies in his book "*Ten Principles for Good Design*." Its design is unobtrusive in that its plain white appearance is 'both neutral and restrained.' It is honest as the wiimote makes no unkept promises to the user in terms of its abilities. It has its buttons and its accelerometers and nothing more. Further, its use is self explanatory. I now ask you to think of the first thing you do when you pick up a TV-related remote that you don't know how to use. Perhaps you point it at the screen! Upon powering on the wii, the remote can be used simply by pointing it at what it is the user wants to do, aided by a pointer that appears on the TV screen. The wii remote's technological innovation in its use of accelerometers helps facilitate natural and self-evident ease of use and functionality for the user.  
  While I hadn't thought much of it before, the wii remote is a prime example of good design.
