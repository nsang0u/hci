subtitle: Using a Regression Model to Catch Spoilers Before it's Too Late 
---

I took a Statistics course titled Regression and Forecasting. As my final project, I worked with a teammate to develop a natural 
language processing prediction model to determine whether a review in an iMDB film review dataset contained a spoiler. The model is 
somewhat rudimentary in the complexity of its predictors, but shows power in its predictiveness. Since the completion of the project, 
I am working to derive and incorporate more predictors and increase the power of the algorithm. This is an interesting topic of further 
research through which I am working to develop further experience with natural language processing algorithms that I can apply to 
interesting problems in the future.
