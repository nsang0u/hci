title: HCI: Amarteurs
subtitle: A Product Design Process for CS376: Human Computer Interaction

In Fall 2018, I took a design-focused course on HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), in which I worked with a team to apply UX/UI design principles to develop a product proposal for the Williams College Museum of Art. 

You'll find our design, amarteurs in the Project Website link below.
